# AI Music Generator

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

An AI music generator to be used in agriculture, experimenting with different melodies and collecting data to optimize model performance. The idea is that this music generator would utilize AI to continuously improve its performance in creating the best melodies and frequencies for plants. The supervised robotic assistant would collect info about the plants (for example their growth, vitality, and rates of disease), the soil and its microbial composition, levels of rainfall and sunshine, and more in order to holistically assess the model’s performance.

## Background

This AI idea could solve a multitude of problems relating to agriculture and farming. We are currently facing many agricultural crises worldwide with depleted soils, droughts and floods, loss of biodiversity, and more. As an adjunct to healthy agriculture practices (such as the avoidance of pesticides and GMOs, crop rotations, and silvopasture). Healthier, happier plants equals better yields and greater sustainability.

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.


## How is it used?

The development and use of this program would require collaboration between specialized experts in regenerative agriculture and AI. The goal would be to develop an accessible and easy-to-use AI system that could be easily trained and used by farmers, with strong safeguards in place to prevent abuse.

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kinds of situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```
## Data sources and AI methods

Linear regression, logistic regression, the nearest neighbor method, neural networks, and other machine learning techniques would likely be utilized, with a particular focus on neural networks and logistic regression. Data would likely be collected from several sources. The model could be trained on datasets of relaxing, classical music, solfeggio frequency recordings, and other music that has been shown to have relaxing effects in humans, animals, and as research continues, plants as well. Most classical music is in the public domain; most recordings of classical music is not. So data would have to be carefully collected to avoid copyright infringement. =

Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?

## Challenges

This AI idea is not a magic bullet fix for all agricultural problems. Its success depends on healthy conditions conducive to environmental and plant health.

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

My focus is on plants; however, it is conceivable that similar models could be developed to support mycelial networks, algae, animals, and humans.

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you need to move on? 

## Acknowledgments

I would like to mention some of the sources of inspiration for this project.  First, I am an amateur musician and I have experienced the healing power of music firsthand and seen it in others. More relevant, I have seen studies demonstrating that when exposed to various frequencies, plants experience increased germination rates, faster growth, lower disease rates and fewer blights, and more. For those interested in learning more, I’ve linked to a PubMed article entitled "Sound perception and its effects in plants and algae" below. Additionally, an online search for “plants and frequencies” yields interesting results.

AI Music Generator readme draft

1.	My idea in a nutshell
      An AI music generator to be used in agriculture. The idea is that this music generator would utilize AI to continuously improve its performance in creating the best melodies and frequencies for plants. The supervised robotic assistant would collect info about the plants (for example their growth, vitality, and rates of disease), the soil and its microbial composition, levels of rainfall and sunshine, and more in order to holistically assess the model’s performance.
2.	Background
      This AI idea could solve a multitude of problems relating to agriculture and farming. We are currently facing many agricultural crises worldwide with depleted soils, droughts and floods, loss of biodiversity, and more. As an adjunct to healthy agriculture practices (such as the avoidance of pesticides and GMOs, crop rotations, and silvopasture). Healthier, happier plants equals better yields and greater sustainability.
3.	Data and AI techniques
      Linear regression, logistic regression, the nearest neighbor method, neural networks, and other machine learning techniques would likely be utilized, with a particular focus on neural networks and logistic regression.
4.	How is it used?
      The development and use of this program would require collaboration between specialized experts in regenerative agriculture and AI. The goal would be to develop an accessible and easy-to-use AI system that could be easily trained and used by farmers, with strong safeguards in place to prevent abuse.
5.	Challenges
      This AI idea is not a magic bullet fix for all agricultural problems. Its success depends on healthy conditions conducive to environmental and plant health.
6.	What next?
      My focus is on plants; however, it is conceivable that similar models could be developed to support mycelial networks, algae, animals, and humans.
7.	Acknowledgements
      Currently, none. However, I would like to mention some of the sources of inspiration for this project.  First, I am an amateur musician and I have experienced the healing power of music firsthand and seen it in others. More relevant, I have seen studies demonstrating that when exposed to various frequencies, plants experience increased germination rates, faster growth, lower disease rates and fewer blights, and more. For those interested in learning more, I’ve linked to a PubMed article below. Additionally, an online search for “plants and frequencies” yields interesting results.

Note to self: I must update this README to be formatted according to Elements of AI's given format if I want to submit this AI idea to Elements of AI.

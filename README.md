# AI Music Generator

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

An AI music generator to be used in agriculture, experimenting with different melodies and collecting data to optimize model performance. The idea is that this music generator would utilize AI to continuously improve its performance in creating the best melodies and frequencies for plants. The supervised robotic assistant would collect info about the plants (for example their growth, vitality, and rates of disease), the soil and its microbial composition, levels of rainfall and sunshine, and more in order to holistically assess the model’s performance.

## Background

This AI system could solve a multitude of problems relating to agriculture and farming. We are currently facing many agricultural crises in the U.S. and worldwide, including:
* Depleted soils
* Droughts and floods
* Loss of biodiversity
* Overdependence on pesticides
* Many other interrelated problems

While the nature of the global agriculture crisis and its manifestations does vary widely based on reigon and climate, this AI system is likely to provide benefits regardless of the specifics. Additionally, the AI system would be highly adaptable and would learn independently and/or with human supervision (preferred) based on the specific conditions present in an individual deployment.

As an adjunct to healthy agriculture practices (such as the avoidance of pesticides and GMOs, crop rotations, and silvopasture), I believe that this AI system has the potential to
* Accelerate recovery of depleted soils and damaged ecosystems
* Reduce dependence on harmful pesticides
* Nurture biodiversity.

Healthier, happier plants equals better yields and greater sustainability.

## How is it used?

The development and use of this program would require collaboration between specialized experts in regenerative agriculture and AI. The goal would be to develop an accessible and easy-to-use AI system that could be easily trained and used by farmers, with strong safeguards in place to prevent abuse.

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kinds of situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

## Data sources and AI methods

 Data would likely be collected from several sources. The model could be trained on datasets of relaxing, classical music, solfeggio frequency recordings, and other music that has been shown to have relaxing effects in humans, animals, and as research continues, plants as well. One option is to collect data from songs already written and recorded. Most classical music is in the public domain; most recordings of classical music is not. So data would have to be carefully collected to avoid copyright infringement. Another possibility is to generate original music using solfeggio frequencies (for example) and AI methods.

Linear regression, logistic regression, the nearest neighbor method, neural networks, and other machine learning techniques would likely be utilized, with a particular focus on neural networks and logistic regression.

## Challenges

This AI idea is not a magic bullet fix for all agricultural problems. Its success depends on healthy conditions conducive to environmental and plant health and may vary based on numerous factors. Deploying an AI system such as this on a large farm would require a very large number of speakers due to the short distance that sound waves at an ideal volume range for this application would travel. Different frequencies and melodies may have significantly different effects on different plant species, further complicating the system. While quantifying these effects on every species in a particular ecosystem may be near impossible, 

When used as intended, I do not forsee any significant harms or ethical issues. However, successful and ethical deployment requires attention to an ideal volume and the design of the melody generator must be designed carefully to avoid creating dissonent frequencies.

Any model with a thereputic purpose, such as this one, should be thorougly tested in high-quailty trials to ensure its safety and efficacy.


## What next?

My focus is on plants; however, it is conceivable that similar models could be developed to support mycelial networks, algae, animals, and humans.

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you need to move on? 

## Acknowledgments

I would like to mention some of the sources of inspiration for this project.  First, I am an amateur musician and I have experienced the healing power of music firsthand and seen it in others. More relevant, I have seen studies demonstrating that when exposed to various frequencies, plants experience increased germination rates, faster growth, lower disease rates and fewer blights, and more. For those interested in learning more, I’ve linked to a PubMed article entitled "Sound perception and its effects in plants and algae" below. Additionally, an online search for “plants and frequencies” yields interesting results.

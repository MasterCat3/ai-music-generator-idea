# AI Music Generator

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

An AI music generator to be used in agriculture, experimenting with different melodies and collecting data to optimize model performance. The idea is that this music generator would utilize AI to continuously improve its performance in creating the best melodies and frequencies for plants. The supervised robotic assistant would collect info about the plants (for example their growth, vitality, and rates of disease), the soil and its microbial composition, levels of rainfall and sunshine, and more in order to holistically assess the model’s performance.

## Background

We are currently facing many agricultural crises in the U.S. and worldwide, including:
* Depleted soils
* Droughts and floods
* Loss of biodiversity
* Nutrient deficiencies
* Overdependence on pesticides and genetically modified organisms (GMOs)
* Many other interrelated problems

While the nature of the global agriculture crisis and its manifestations does vary widely based on reigon and climate, this AI system is likely to provide benefits regardless of the local environment. Additionally, the AI system would be highly adaptable and would learn independently and/or with human supervision (preferred) based on the specific conditions present in an individual deployment.

As an adjunct to healthy agricultural practices (such as the avoidance of pesticides and GMOs, crop rotations, cover cropping, silvopasture, holistic grazing, and more), I believe that this AI system has the potential to:
* Accelerate recovery of depleted soils and damaged ecosystem
* Reduce dependence on harmful pesticides
* Nurture biodiversity
* Increase crops' nutritional value

Healthier, happier plants equals better yields and greater sustainability.

## How is it used?

This idea is in its infancy and not even a prototype yet. Therefore, it is difficult to say precisely how it will be used. But I will summarize the essential ideas of this AI system below.

This AI system would incorporate machine learning in order to identify and transmit the most benecifical frequencies and melodies to benefit plant well-being on agricultural and other lands. The AI system would be equipped with cameras, sensors, and a soil testing kit and trained to recognize patterns of health and disease in a given landscape, such as a farm.

The development of this AI system would require collaboration between specialized experts in regenerative agriculture and AI. The goal would be to develop an accessible and easy-to-use AI system that could be easily trained and used by farmers, with strong safeguards in place to prevent abuse. Farmers wishing to ultilize this AI system would need to be instructed in its proper use, whether formally or not.

The precise use and specifications of this AI system would depend on its implementation and personal choices by farmers and other persons using such technology, but would invlove at least the following:
* High-quality speakers
* A computer of some sort that would select the songs/frequencies/melodies to be played and transmit them to the speakers. I caution against the use of Wi-Fi or Bluetooth since many studies have found harmful effects on plants from radiofrequency radiation. (a meta-analysis of 45 peer-reviewed scientific publications examining the impact of RF-EMFs can be found at https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15368378.2016.1220389).
* Human supervisors that can turn on/off the system and ensure that it is working properly

If a farmer wants to help the AI to assess and improve its performance, the following technologies may play an important role in the system:
* Robotic assistants equipped with cameras and sensors
* A centralized computer that the supervised robotic assistants would report their data to
* Soil testing kits (may be administered by a farmer or a robotic assistant)

The robotic assistants and/or farmers would report the data they collected to the central computer for the farm and the computer would crunch the numbers to assess the overall effects of the music production.

Anonymized, aggregated data from many farms may be of great value. Ideally, this data would be combined with locally collected data for each deployment (i.e. each farm or subsection of the farm) for maximum performance and benefit.

Farmers may choose to opt out of sharing anon data collected by the AI system to improve the performance and understanding 


## Data sources and AI methods

 Data would likely be collected from several sources. The model could be trained on datasets of relaxing, classical music, solfeggio frequency recordings, and other music that has been shown to have relaxing effects in humans, animals, and as research continues, plants as well. One option is to collect data from songs already written and recorded. Most classical music is in the public domain; most recordings of classical music are not. So data would have to be carefully collected to avoid copyright infringement. Another possibility is to generate original music using solfeggio frequencies (for example) and AI methods.

Linear regression, logistic regression, the nearest neighbor method, neural networks, and other machine learning techniques would likely be utilized, with a particular focus on neural networks and logistic regression.

## Challenges

This AI idea is not a magic bullet fix for all agricultural problems. Its success depends on healthy conditions conducive to environmental and plant health and may vary based on numerous factors. Deploying an AI system such as this on a large farm would require a very large number of speakers due to the short distance that sound waves at an ideal volume range for this application would travel. Different frequencies and melodies may have significantly different effects on different plant species, further complicating the system. While quantifying these effects on every species in a particular ecosystem may be near impossible, I believe a well-trained AI model would be able to gather sufficient data to make a quality assessment of the health of the farm.

When used as intended, I do not forsee any significant harms or ethical issues. However, successful and ethical deployment requires attention to an ideal volume and the design of the melody generator in order to have a beneficial effect and avoid playing dissonent frequencies.

Any model with a utilitarian and/or thereputic purpose, such as this one, should be thorougly tested in high-quailty studies and experiments to ensure its safety and efficacy.


## What next?

My focus is on plants in agricultural settings; however, it is conceivable that similar models could be developed to support plants, mycelial networks, algae, animals, and humans in many different contexts. It is my hope that thoughtful AI developers, musicians, conservationists, farmers, biologists, and experts from other related fields will work together to achieve the successful implementaion and evolution of AI systems such as this one.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to mention some of the sources of inspiration for this project.  First, I am an amateur musician and I have experienced the healing power of music firsthand and seen it in others. More relevant, I have seen studies demonstrating that when exposed to various frequencies, plants experience increased germination rates, faster growth, lower disease rates and fewer blights, and more. For those interested in learning more, I’ve linked to a PubMed article entitled "Sound perception and its effects in plants and algae" below. Additionally, an online search for “plants and frequencies” yields interesting results.
